# Hacker Fab - Stepper V2

This repository contains the software for The Hacker Fab's open source photolithography stepper. It provides a desktop interface for pattern projection, micropositioning stage control, real-time computer vision alignment, timed ultraviolet (UV) exposure, and exposure footprint mapping.

## Quick Start

### Python Setup with UV (Recommended)

The [UV project manager](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) handles virtual environment creation, Python runtime management (Python ≥ 3.10), and dependency resolution automatically:

```bash
uv run src/gui.py
```

To run with a custom configuration file:
```bash
uv run src/gui.py custom_config.toml
```

### Python Setup with Standard venv

Ensure you are using **Python 3.10 or newer**:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To install optional hardware drivers (e.g. Basler camera, GRBL, OMM stage, alignment YOLO models):
```bash
pip install -e '.[grbl,omm,alignment,basler,dlpc]'
```

Launch the GUI:
```bash
python src/gui.py
```

## Configuration Overview

The software uses a [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) configuration file to configure hardware drivers and exposure operations. On startup, the application looks for `default.toml` in the repository root or accepts a `.toml` path as a command-line argument.

```toml
# Camera configuration
[camera]
type = "webcam"       # Options: "webcam", "pylon", "flir", "amscope", "dummy", "none"

[camera.webcam]
index = 0

# Motion stage configuration
[stage]
type = "omm"          # Options: "omm", "grbl", "dummy"

[stage.omm]
port = "COM6"
baud-rate = 921600

# Projector and LED hardware channel gating
[projector]
dlpc_enabled = false
uv_led_drive_level = 150

# Automated operations
[alignment]
enabled = false
model_path = "ckpts/best.pt"

[tiling]
enabled = false

[autofocus]
enabled = false
```

Detailed descriptions and tuning instructions for all hardware and operational parameters can be found in the documentation below.
